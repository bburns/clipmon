;;;; Description
;; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; Clipmon is a clipboard monitor - it watches the system clipboard and can
;; automatically insert any new text into the current location in Emacs.
;;
;; It also adds changes to the system clipboard to the kill ring, making Emacs
;; into a clipboard manager for text - you can then use a package like
;; browse-kill-ring or helm-ring to view and manage your clipboard history.
;;
;; **Warning (2015-12-24): in an X-windows system with clipmon-mode on, bringing
;;   up a graphical menu (e.g. Shift+Mouse-1) will cause Emacs to hang. See
;;   http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=22214.
;;   X-windows starts a timer when checking the contents of the clipboard, which
;;   interferes with the clipmon timer.**
;;
;; Update (2016-01-27): in an X-windows system, Clipmon now uses the clipboard
;; instead of the primary selection - see https://github.com/bburns/clipmon/issues/4.
;;
;; You can use Clipmon for taking notes from a webpage, for example - just copy the
;; text you want to save and it will be added to Emacs. It helps to have an
;; autocopy feature or addon for the browser, e.g. AutoCopy 2 for Firefox - then
;; you can just select text to add it to Emacs.
;;
;; Here's a diagram - text flows from the top to the bottom:

;;
;; The solid line is turned on and off with `clipmon-mode', while the dotted
;; line is turned on and off with `clipmon-autoinsert-toggle', usually bound to a key.
;; There are also various transformations you can perform on the text, e.g.
;; adding newlines to the end.
;;
;; (Emacs's kill-ring is like the system clipboard but with multiple items in
;; it. If you copy a bunch of things in another program, Emacs normally only
;; knows about the last one copied, but with clipmon mode on, it will monitor
;; the system clipboard and add any new text it sees to the kill ring.)
;;
;;
;;;; Installation
;; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; It's simplest to use the package manager:
;;
;;     M-: (package-install 'clipmon)
;;
;; It will then be ready to use, and will also be available the next time you
;; start Emacs.
;;
;;
;;;; Usage
;; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; To give it a try, do M-: (clipmon-autoinsert-toggle) - this will turn on
;; autoinsert. Then go to another application and copy some text to the
;; clipboard - clipmon should detect it after a second or two and make a beep.
;; If you switch back to Emacs, the text should be there in your buffer.
;;
;; Note that you can still yank and pull text in Emacs as usual while autoinsert
;; is on, since it only monitors the system clipboard.
;;
;; You can turn off autoinsert with the same command - to add a keybinding to it
;; add something like this to your init file:
;;
;;     (global-set-key (kbd "<M-f2>") 'clipmon-autoinsert-toggle)
;;
;; You can also turn it on and off from the Options menu.
;;
;; Also, if no change is detected after a certain number of minutes, autoinsert will
;; turn itself off automatically with another beep. This is so you don't forget
;; that autoinsert is on and accidentally add text to your buffer.
;;
;; And note: if you happen to copy the same text to the clipboard twice, clipmon
;; won't know about the second time, as it only detects changes. And if you copy
;; text faster than the timer interval is set it may miss some changes, but you
;; can adjust the interval.
;;
;;
;;;; Using as a clipboard manager
;; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; To try out clipmon as a clipboard manager, make sure clipmon-mode is on by
;; doing M-: (clipmon-mode 1) (also accessible from the Options menu) and that
;; autoinsert is off, then copy a few pieces of text from another program (more
;; slowly than the default timer interval of 2 seconds though). Switch back to
;; Emacs, and see that you can yank any of the text back with C-y, M-y, M-y...
;;
;; Note that when you turn on autoinsert, it also turns on clipmon-mode, to
;; capture text to the kill ring, but if you'd like to turn on clipmon-mode
;; automatically, you can add this to your init file:
;;
;;     ;; monitor the system clipboard and add any changes to the kill ring
;;     (add-to-list 'after-init-hook 'clipmon-mode-start)
;;
;; You can also use the package browse-kill-ring to manage the kill ring - you
;; can install it with M-: (package-install 'browse-kill-ring), then call
;; `browse-kill-ring' to see the contents of the kill ring, insert from it,
;; delete items, etc. Helm also has a package called helm-ring, with the
;; function `helm-show-kill-ring'.
;;
;; You can persist the kill ring between sessions if you'd like (though note
;; that this might involve writing sensitive information like passwords to the
;; disk - although you could always delete such text from the kill ring with
;; `browse-kill-ring-delete'). To do so, add this to your init file:
;;
;;     ;; persist the kill ring between sessions
;;     (add-to-list 'after-init-hook 'clipmon-persist)
;;
;; This will use Emacs's savehist library to save the kill ring, both at the end
;; of the session and at set intervals. However, savehist also saves various
;; other settings by default, including the minibuffer history - see
;; `savehist-mode' for more details. To change the autosave interval, add
;; something like this:
;;
;;     (setq savehist-autosave-interval (* 5 60)) ; save every 5 minutes (default)
;;
;; The kill ring has a fixed number of entries which you can set, depending on
;; how much history you want to save between sessions:
;;
;;     (setq kill-ring-max 500) ; default is 60 in Emacs 24.4
;;
;; To see how much space the kill-ring is taking up, you can call this function:
;;
;;     (clipmon-kill-ring-total)
;;     => 29670 characters
;;
;;
;;;; Options
;; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; There are various options you can set with customize:
;;
;;     (customize-group 'clipmon)
;;
;; or set them in your init file - these are the default values:
;;
;;     (setq clipmon-timer-interval 2)       ; check system clipboard every n secs
;;     (setq clipmon-autoinsert-sound t)     ; t for included beep, or path or nil
;;     (setq clipmon-autoinsert-color "red") ; color of cursor when autoinsert is on
;;     (setq clipmon-autoinsert-timeout 5)   ; stop autoinsert after n mins inactivity
;;
;; before inserting the text, transformations are performed on it in this order:
;;
;;     (setq clipmon-transform-trim t)        ; remove leading whitespace
;;     (setq clipmon-transform-remove         ; remove text matching this regexp
;;           "\\[[0-9][0-9]?[0-9]?\\]\\|\\[citation needed\\]\\|\\[by whom?\\]")
;;     (setq clipmon-transform-prefix "")     ; add to start of text
;;     (setq clipmon-transform-suffix "\n\n") ; add to end of text
;;     (setq clipmon-transform-function nil)  ; additional transform function
;;
;;
;;;; Todo
;; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; - Prefix with C-u to set a target point, then allow cut/copy/pasting from
;;   within Emacs, eg to take notes from another buffer, or move text elsewhere.
